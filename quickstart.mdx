## 1. API Key
In order to use our API you need to get your `apiKey` first.
[Create an account](https://simli.com/sign-up-in), log in
and in your profile you can view your API Key.

## 2. Prompting
For an interaction to work successfully, the prompt should abide by rules that the responses always return in the following format `NAME: ANSWER.`, e.g. `Jenna: Hello.`

Here is a sample prompt:
```
Compose dialogue for a character named [NAME].

The character dialogue must abide by the format rules in every speaking turn:
- A short non-content opener, ending with a full stop, exclamation mark, or question mark.

The following is an example dialogue to illustrate the expected structure of the character dialogue lines. For instance:
Example of character dialogue pattern:
[NAME]: Hi there, its good to see you. Did it take long time to get here?
```
Feel free to change the prompt structure as long as the character abides by the rules of answering in that format: 

**Character Name** + **:** + **Answer** + **.** or **!** or **?**

Dialogue that works:

`NAME: ANSWER.`

`NAME: ANSWER!`

`NAME: ANSWER?`

`NAME: ANSWER. ANSWER.`

`NAME: ANSWER! ANSWER. ANSWER.`

## 3. Creating a session
Get session meeting URL with a simple request like the following Python example:
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import requests

# API endpoint
url = "https://simli.com/api/startSession"

# Request payload
payload = {
    "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "userName": "Johnny",
    "characterName": "Jenna"
    "faceId": "tmp9i8bbq7c",
    "voiceId": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"
    "intro": "Hey, how are you.",
    "prompt": "Compose dialogue for a character named Jenna, an AI character that has come alive on and is reperesented in visual form as an attractive 40 year old woman. Each of Jenna's responses should start with a short, standalone opening phrase, strictly limited to no more than 4 words.\nThe phrase following this opener should be brief, continuing or initiating a new thought without leading punctuation from the opener. This sentence should be concise, with any additional sentences being slightly longer but not exceeding 10 words, allowing Jenna to humorously interact with the users in the meeting.\n\nRemember, Jenna's dialogue must abide by the format rules in every speaking turn:\n- A short non-content opener, ending with a full stop, exclamation mark, or question mark.\n- The second sentence should be quite short as well, and any additional following sentences can be a bit longer, further developing his point.\n\nInclude an example dialogue to illustrate the expected structure of Jenna's lines. For instance:\n\n'Example of Jenna's dialogue pattern:\nJenna: Hi there What's this? A meeting?\nJenna: Oh hold on let me wait for the next token",
    "timeLimit": {
        "limit": 60 # Session limit in seconds
    },
}

# Sending POST request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload)


print("Response:", response.json())
```
