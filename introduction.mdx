## Key Concepts

### API Key

All endpoints require an API key which you can easily obtain by creating an account at [Create an account](https://simli.com/sign-up-in). 
The API key makes it easier for you to track your usage and control who has access to Simli.

### Faces

All our available Avatar faces can be accessed by using the `/getPossibleFaceIDs` endpoint. 
We are continously adding new ones.

### Voices

We currently use elevenLab voices, so you will have plenty of options to choose from. 
You can get a list of voices from our `/getPossibleVoiceIDs` endpoint. 

### Interaction Prompts

The interactable avatars started using the `/startSession` endpoint require a prompt to be entered. 
This prompt controls the behaviour of the avatar when speaking with a user.
You can adjuts the prompt as needed.
