# An API with endless possibilities.

With visual lipsynced AI avatars like our API gives you, anything is possible: mock interviews, sales assistants, language training, coaching, CS training, historical characters and so much more. [Try our demo](https://www.simli.com/demo).

## Key Concepts

### 1. API Key
All endpoints require an API key which you can easily obtain by creating an account at [Create an account](https://simli.com/sign-up-in).
The API key makes it easier for you to track your usage and control who has access to Simli.

### 2. Faces
All our available Avatar faces can be accessed by using the `/getPossibleFaceIDs` endpoint.
We are continously adding new ones.

### 3. WebSocket
Stream PCM16 audio bytes to our LipsyncStream WebSocket to recieve video and audio bytes to be decoded accoring to the [WebSocket scheme](/api-reference/endpoint/LipsyncStream).

### 4. Simli React SDK
Get started by using our Simli React SDK to handle WebSocket communication, decode recieved bytes and sync audio & video playback.
