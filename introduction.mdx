## An API with endless possibilities.

With visual lipsynced AI avatars like our API gives you, anything is possible: mock interviews, sales assistants, language training, coaching, CS training, historical characters and so much more. [Try our demo](https://www.simli.com/demo).

## How it works?
Our API comprimises of two main components:
- `/startAudioToVideoSession` API to initialize a session.
- `/StartWebRTCSession` API to start streaming `PCM16` audio bytes to video. 

For non-WebRTC experts, we made it easier for you to get started using our `simli-client` SDK to handle all the WebRTC communication.

<Info>
We encourage you to learn more about [WebRTC](/api-reference/webrtc-info)
