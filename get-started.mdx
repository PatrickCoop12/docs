## Key Concepts

1. **API Key**: Our endpoint require an API key which you can easily obtain by creating an account at [Create an account](https://simli.com/sign-up-in).
The API key makes it easier for you to track your usage and control who has access to Simli.

2. **Faces**: All our available Avatar faces can be accessed through: [Available Faces](/api-reference/available-faces).
We are continously adding new ones.

3. **WebRTC**: Stream PCM16 audio bytes to our WebRTC componenet to start recieving media.

<Step>
## Download simli-webrtc-react componenet

Download and import the componenet inside your react project.

[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/simliai/simli-webrtc-react-sdk)


</Step>
<Step>
## Setup the componenet and Stream Audio
1. Intialize a React ref
```js
const webRTC = useRef(null);
```
2. Add ref to the componenet
```js
<WebRTCComponent ref={webRTC} faceID={'tmp9i8bbq7c'} />
```
3. Call start function
```js
webRTC.current.start();
```
4. Stream audio using `sendAudioData()`

AudioData should be of type `PCM16` and sample rate `16KHz`

```js
if (webRTC.current) {
    webRTC.current.sendAudioData(audioData);
}
```
If done successfully, you will recieve media to be rendered on your frontend.
