If you sent a chunk of audio that you no longer want to be played, you can achieve so using both the simli-client SDK (version 1.1.5 or higher) or the API. This is commonly used to achieve interruptions like behavior (you still have to have a method to decide when to interrupt and reflect that interruption in other places in your system, most likely the LLM).

- simli-client SDK:

``` javascript
client: SimliClient
client.ClearBuffer()
```

- Simli API:

``` javascript
dc: RTCDataChannel
dc.send("SKIP")
```
