## Welcome

This page will explain each API and it's details.

## `/startSession`

The `/startSession` endpoint starts a daily room dedicated for your interaction. 
It responds with a daily url which can be used standalone (follow the url and have an interaction with your avatar)
, or embed the link into a daily code snippet that can be used in Web or mobile across many frameworks. (Javascript, React, React Native, Android, iOS)
For more info on the daily sdk that you can use to embed the interaction into your project, head over to [daily-reference](https://docs.daily.co/guides/products/call-object)

```tsx React JS Example

// Create a daily call object
callObject = DailyIframe.createCallObject({
                videoSource: false,
              });

// Set user's name in the room
callObject.setUserName(firstName);
callObject.setLocalVideo(false);

// Join the room with the 
// url returned by /startSession endpoint
callObject.join({ url }).then(async () => {
          if (callObject === null || callObject === undefined) {
            return;
          }
          console.log(await callObject.setInputDevicesAsync(inputDevie));
        });
        
return (
  <DailyProvider callObject={callObject}>
          <Call
            onCancel={reloadPage}
            onCallEnd={startLeavingCall}
            onStuck={handleJennaStuck}
          />
  </DailyProvider>
);
```

## `/isSessionAvailable`

The total number of interactions are limited as such we've created a handy endpoint that you can call to know if the servers have a slot available
for a live interaction.

```json Example Response
{
  "isAvailable": true
}
```

## `/getPossibleVoiceIDs`

Currently elevenlab voices are used. You can check list of currently supported voices using this endpoint.

## `/getPossibleFaceIDs`

All our available Avatar faces can be accessed by using the `/getPossibleFaceIDs` endpoint. 
We are continously adding new ones.
