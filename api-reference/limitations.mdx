## Time limit

The live interactions started by the api `/startSession` have a time limit parameter. 
The maximum time a session can last as of now is 5 minutes or 180 seconds. 
As such there is a minimum limit as well. Which is 1 minute or 60 seconds.
You can contact us if your use case requires a higher limit.
